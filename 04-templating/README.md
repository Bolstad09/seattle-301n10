=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Templates have some advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog by adding in a templating library! We use templating to abstract away the tiresome work of DOM rendering, and this practice is applied in many front-end libraries and frameworks.*

## Daily Plan


## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
